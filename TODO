API
	Core
		- Importing of data in XML, OR CSV
		- Write tests to ensure that :at attribute is a utc time and can be set by a string, object or number and the time is mapped to the correct time zone so there is no tz attribute but still stores the tz attribute
		- parent child relationships (ancestry gem)
	Unit Conversion
		- seed the database with different unit types and groups for different datatypes to support conversion to the default unit (only stored in the default unit type)
	Schema
		- Creating field keys on initial feed request
		
	Reports
		- strong_parameters mass assignment of elasticsearch report querys
	Percolator
		- filters on whether rows should be added to database or not (like validations on the data) (If query is met then row is not added to the database)
		- strong_parameters mass assignment of elasticsearch percolator querys
	Subscriptions
		- Add support for various Pub/Sub providers
			MQTT
			ZeroMQ
			Socket.io
			Faye
			ROS
	DataRetention
		- Amount of time to hold on to data or remove data
		(On a topic (time in days to hold on to certain data))
	Security
		- Securing the API with API KEYS
		- Feed Security (Public (No API Key), Shared (multi-tennant),	Private (single api key single user))
		-whitelist or black list of ip's
		- Authorization based on User or api key?
	- foreigner for generating foreign keys
	- Multi-tennantcy
	- Performance and Profiling Testing

// UI
	Form for creating an Elastic Search query (used also to create percolate queries)
	Form for creating facet like reports from queries

// Modules

	// Inputs
		// various website API's (twitter)
		- watcher for a file drop and then send the batch to the service (csv,sqlite, etc)
		- an application with a database connection which polls the database for changes periodically looking for changes tha may have occured since the last time it check (like solrs dataimport)
