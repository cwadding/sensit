- Fix generators and conflict with Doorkeeper preventing the generator from running
- use of NodeRED for configuring different services with sensit




-Auditing with PaperTrail gem?

		- generator will generate the new doorkeeper configuration file for sensit
		- customize views for sensit application
		- create user sessions html version
	Core

		- parent child relationships (ancestry gem)		
		- Importing of data in XML, OR CSV
		- Amount of time to hold on to data or remove data
		(On a topic (time in days to hold on to certain data))		
		- Creating field keys on initial feed request
	Reports
		- use validate api to validate that queries are correct before saving
		- hook in Schema to make sure that any fields in queries are the correct type for the value
		- strong_parameters mass assignment of elasticsearch report querys
	Percolator
		- strong_parameters mass assignment of elasticsearch percolator querys
	Subscriptions
		- Add support for various Pub/Sub providers
			ZeroMQ
			Socket.io
			Faye
			pubnub(https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pubnub#get-pubnub-gem)
	Security
		- Rack-Attack: https://github.com/kickstarter/rack-attack (black listing and whitelisting rate limiting)
		- Feed Security (Public (No API Key), Shared (multi-tennant),	Private (single api key single user))
	Unit Conversion
		- seed the database with different unit types and groups for different datatypes to support conversion to the default unit (only stored in the default unit type)		
	- Multi-tennantcy
	- Performance and Profiling Testing

// Modules

	// Inputs
		// various website API's (twitter)
		- watcher for a file drop and then send the batch to the service (csv,sqlite, etc)
		- an application with a database connection which polls the database for changes periodically looking for changes that may have occured since the last time it check (like solrs dataimport)
	// Analysis
		// Machine learning or other rule processing based api
		// Pattern rules
		// forecasting using kalman or particle filters while observing the data
	// Actions
