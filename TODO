API
	OAuth
		- generator to run the doorkeeper generator
		- generator will generate the new doorkeeper configuration file for sensit
		- customize views for sensit application
		- create user sessions html version
	Core
		-support http compression (config.middleware.use Rack::Deflater)
			http://calebwoods.github.io/http-compression-rails/
		- Be able to search feeds (use the the subset of queries from the percolator for strong parameters)
		- parent child relationships (ancestry gem)		
		- Importing of data in XML, OR CSV
		- Amount of time to hold on to data or remove data
		(On a topic (time in days to hold on to certain data))		
	Schema
		- Creating field keys on initial feed request
	Reports
		- use validate api to validate that queries are correct before saving
		- hook in Schema to make sure that any fields in queries are the correct type for the value
		- strong_parameters mass assignment of elasticsearch report querys
	Percolator
		- strong_parameters mass assignment of elasticsearch percolator querys
	Subscriptions
		- Add support for various Pub/Sub providers
			MQTT
			ZeroMQ
			Socket.io
			Faye
			ROS
	Security
		- Rack-Attack: https://github.com/kickstarter/rack-attack
		- Feed Security (Public (No API Key), Shared (multi-tennant),	Private (single api key single user))
		-whitelist or black list of ip's
		- Authorization based on User or api key?
	Unit Conversion
		- seed the database with different unit types and groups for different datatypes to support conversion to the default unit (only stored in the default unit type)		
	- foreigner for generating foreign keys
	- Multi-tennantcy
	- Performance and Profiling Testing

	- filters on whether rows should be added to database or not (like validations on the data) (If query is met then row is not added to the database)

	- on create use instead of passing back model render(:json => "{\"location\":#{sensit_topic_url(@topic)}}", :status => :created))
	- on update use instead of passing back model render(:json => "{\"location\":#{sensit_topic_url(@topic)}}", :status => :ok))

//API Design Resources
https://www.stormpath.com/blog/designing-rest-json-apis

// UI
	Form for creating an Elastic Search query (used also to create percolate queries)
	Form for creating facet like reports from queries
	Visualization of reports

// Client libraries for the API
https://github.com/pksunkara/alpaca

// Modules

	// Inputs
		// various website API's (twitter)
		- watcher for a file drop and then send the batch to the service (csv,sqlite, etc)
		- an application with a database connection which polls the database for changes periodically looking for changes that may have occured since the last time it check (like solrs dataimport)
	// Analysis
		// Machine learning or other rule processing based api
		// Pattern rules
	// Actions
		// Downloading an image from a camera
			// Module to manage connections to various NAS's
		// Sending notifications
