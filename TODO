API
	- Importing of data in XML, OR CSV
	- filters on whether rows should be added to database or not (like validations on the data)
	- Write tests to ensure that :at attribute is a utc time and can be set by a string, object or number and the time is mapped to the correct time zone so there is no tz attribute but still stores the tz attribute
	- for topics, set the id rather than using database id
	- Creating field keys on initial feed request
	- seed the database with different unit types and groups for different datatypes to support conversion to the default unit (only stored in the default unit type)
	- strong_parameters mass assignment of elasticsearch reports and percolator querys
	- Resource to add subscribers to certain feeds of data
	- Add support for various Pub/Sub providers
		MQTT
		ZeroMQ
		Socket.io
		Faye
		ROS
	- Securing the API with API KEYS
	- be able to generate a report
	- Possibly add Multi-tennantcy
